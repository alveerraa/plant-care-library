## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This app allows users to:

- Browse a library of houseplants
- Search by plant name in real-time
- Filter by plant care levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Click a plant to view its full details in a pop-up modal

## Tech Stack & Choices

### Technologies Used
- **React.js** â€“ Functional components with hooks for modern and clean state management
- **JavaScript** â€“ For logic and interactivity
- **CSS** â€“ Used for styling, transitions, and responsiveness
- **Git** â€“ Version control

### Technical Decisions
- **Local JSON file as mock API**: I chose to import `plantsData.js` directly to simulate API data for simplicity.
- **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`): I opted for Hooks for concise and functional state management.
- **CSS for styling**: Since the project is small, vanilla CSS was sufficient. I added hover effects, animations, and a responsive grid layout without the need for an external UI library.
- **Modal for plant details**: Instead of routing to a new page, I used a modal for a smoother user experience.

## Challenges Faced

-I wanted the app to look clean and approachable without using heavy UI libraries. So, getting the balance right with basic CSS animations and responsiveness took a bit of experimentation.

-Setting up the modal for plant details without using external libraries was tricky at first. I had to make sure clicking outside the modal or hitting escape would close it properly without breaking anything.

-At first, I used a .json file, but switching to a JavaScript file (plantsData.js) made it easier to load local images using require(), which React didnâ€™t support directly from JSON.

## Assumptions Made

-I assumed users would be using the app on modern browsers and relatively recent devices, so I didnâ€™t do any legacy browser compatibility work.

-Since this is a demo project, I used freely available images from Google instead of hosting my own or sourcing them from a plant database.
